# image-caption-generator
**An exploration of deep learning models using computer vision and natural language processing techniques.**

- Trained on datasets of images paired with human-written captions - using the Flickr8K and MSCOCO datasets.
- Three main architectures will be explored:
A convolutional neural network plus recurrent neural network architecture
An attention-based mechanism which improves relevancy through visual guidance, and
Transformer models designed for parallelized computation and enhanced contextual modeling through self-attention.
